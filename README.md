## ðŸš€ Projects

1. **Inventory Management Application**  
   *Technologies:* Java, React, MongoDB, TypeScript, HTML, JSON  
   - Developed a full-stack inventory management system to manage product stocks, transactions, and orders. Integrated **React** for the frontend, **Java** for backend services, and **MongoDB** for database management. 

2. **Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning**  
   *Technologies:* Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, matplotlib, NLP  
   - Created a machine learning model using **NLP** techniques like **TF-IDF** and **word2vec**. Trained using the **Naive Bayes Classifier**, the model achieved high accuracy in identifying fake news. Data preprocessing and visualization were implemented using **NumPy** and **matplotlib**.

3. **Movie Recommendation App**  
   *Technologies:* JavaScript, React, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Docker  
   - Built a **movie recommendation platform** that provides personalized movie suggestions. **NodeJS** handled the backend, while **React** powered the frontend. The app was deployed using **Docker** containers managed by **Kubernetes** and utilized **PostgreSQL** for data persistence.

4. **JEDAI: An Educational System for AI Planning and Reasoning**  
   *Technologies:* JavaScript, Python, Docker, HTML, CSS, Java  
   - Contributed to the development of an AI-powered educational platform to teach AI planning concepts through mobile robots. Utilized **Java** for backend microservices and **JavaScript** for frontend UI, running inside **Docker** containers.
